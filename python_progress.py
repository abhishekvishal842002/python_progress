# len function only calculates the length of any string

# concatenation means (jorna) + , *
# + concatenation works with string + string
# * concatenation works with string * int  (string*(n times)

# String Slicing 
# x[a:b:c]
# Here, 
# a is the starting index of the string and is included.
# b is the ending index and is not included. (i.e b is excluded).
# c is the hopping point or jumping point .



# i=0
# while i<=10 :
#     print("ankit has many akanksha!"+str(i))
#     i=int(i)+1

# for loops

# for i in range (0,10,1) :
#     print("ankit is gone!"+str(i))

# here in range(a,b,c)
# a= initialisation which means starting point and is by default 0.
# b= ending point which means the index upto which the loop will iterate
# c= jumping value which means at which place it will jump simultaneously and it is by default 1.

# Importing modules
# sqrt()
# pow()
# intrand()




# below are the three methods to import modules in python code

# method 1;
# import math
# print(math.sqrt(4))
# print(math.pow(4,2))

# method 2;
# from math import sqrt,pow ; from random import randint
# print(sqrt(4))
# print(pow(4,2))
# print(randint(1,10))

#method 3;
# from math import * ; from random import *
# print(sqrt(4))
# print(pow(4,2))
# print(randint(1,10))


# functions

# def addition1(a,b):
#     add=a+b
#     return add

# print(addition1(2,3))  
# print(addition1(5,6))



# def percentage(a,b):

#     return percent 

# print(percentage(47.5,50))
# print(percentag(3,4))

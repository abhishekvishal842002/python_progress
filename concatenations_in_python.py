# first = input("enter first number: ")
# second = input("enter second number: ")

# sum = int(first) + int(second)
# print(sum)


#another issue is thatb we cannot concatenate string with int;
#lets see 


first = input("enter first number: ")
second = input("enter second number: ")

sum = int(first) + int(second)
print("the sum is " + str(sum))
